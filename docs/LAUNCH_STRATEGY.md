# üéØ HEXTRA API - Launch Strategy & Viral Content

## The Story That Spreads

### **The Hook:** "38 Years, Global Research, One Perfect API"

**For Developer Communities:**
*"After 38 years of evaluating every detection method globally - from Eastern philosophy to Western mathematics - I've distilled the optimal solution into a single API endpoint that solves what others can't."*

**For Universities:**
*"A masterclass in computer vision research methodology - how systematic global evaluation of detection algorithms led to the identification of the optimal approach for real-world garment detection."*

**For Big Companies:**
*"The industry standard for garment detection - battle-tested across thousands of edge cases, from Times Square street photography to studio product shots."*
